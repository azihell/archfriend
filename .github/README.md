# My <img src="https://github.com/azihell/archfriend/blob/main/.github/images/Arch-svg.svg" width="30" title="Arch">friend tutorial

I wrote a small tutorial for a full <img src="https://github.com/azihell/archfriend/blob/main/.github/images/Arch-svg.svg" width="20" title="Arch Linux"> installation. It aims to provide a system with <img src="https://github.com/azihell/archfriend/blob/main/.github/images/Arch-svg.svg" width="15" title="Arch Linux"> and <img src="https://github.com/azihell/archfriend/blob/main/.github/images/Windows.svg" width="15" title="Windows"> which is my usual setup. 
> ⚠️ I believe these instructions will help you **even if you don't multiboot with <img src="https://github.com/azihell/archfriend/blob/main/.github/images/Windows.svg" width="15" title="Windows">, but other Linux distro instead**.

That's it for this README. Check the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/azihell/archfriend/wiki) out!
